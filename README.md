# Rust Data Engineering - Coursera

This is the repo that will hold all libraries and binaries that are made from this course. This README will also be updated as the course progresses and give information about each subdirectory that is created within this project. This code is made following the instructional material from the course: Rust Data Engineering on Coursera, taught by Noah Gift. I do not claim any of this code as my own IP, and am using this as a means to practice examples from the course.

# Week 1:
Fruit salads: These projects are used to show different operations on types of collections in Rust. There is a simple Vec, a VecDeque, a LL, and a CLI tool. 

HashMaps: These project show simple ways that hashmaps can be implemented, and some useful features, such as ranking occurances and data operations on the set.
